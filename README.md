## How to play
You are the pilot of a spaceship (maybe one among dozens), and your task is destroy all the enemies that you can for saving the Earth. In order to comply with this important duty, you can drive the spaceship and make it avoid the enemies'shots(lasers) using arrow keys (ü°±ü°≥ü°∞ü°≤) and shoot the enemies spacebar.

Your enemies include a carrier ship,chasership and gunship.


When you click on New Game, the spaceship will start in the bottom of the screen, and the enemies will come from the top with differents velocities.
